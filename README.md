# TODO CLI App

Just a simple Todo App. My first real project on Rust.

### Features
Pretty standard
- Add Todos
- Delete Todos
- View Todo List
- It also persists with like a simple json file.
Very standard stuff

### Usage
#### Commands
To add:
```bash
cargo run -- add "Title" "Description"
```
To view all:
```bash
cargo run -- list
```
To delete specific
```bash
cargo run -- delete numberoftodo
```
